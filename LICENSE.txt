     or synthetic data generation
   - "Dataset" means any collection used for AI training purposes

2. ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS
   If you include This Work in any Dataset or use it for AI Training:

   a) You MUST provide clear attribution including:
      - Repository URL
      - License type (Palimpsest v0.8)
      - Original author(s) as listed in MAINTAINERS.md
      - Date of inclusion

   b) You MUST maintain this attribution in any derivative datasets

3. TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS
   You MUST publicly disclose:

   a) That This Work was included in your dataset
   b) The approximate volume/percentage of your dataset consisting of This Work
   c) The purpose of the AI model being trained
   d) Whether the resulting model is commercial or non-commercial

4. ETHICAL USE REQUIREMENTS
   You MUST NOT use This Work for AI Training if the resulting model will:

   c) Make consequential decisions about individuals without human oversight
      (e.g., hiring, lending, criminal justice)
   d) Generate spam, misinformation, or malicious content at scale
   e) Circumvent content moderation or safety systems

5. OPT-OUT MECHANISM
   If the original authors add an ".ai-exclude" file to this repository,
   you MUST remove This Work from your dataset within 90 days and cease
   using it for new AI Training.

6. SHARE-ALIKE FOR DATASETS
   If you create a derived dataset that includes This Work, that dataset
   MUST be released under:
   - A license at least as permissive as this one, OR
   - A fully open license (CC0, CC-BY, Apache 2.0, MIT, etc.)

7. COMMERCIAL USE
   Commercial AI Training is permitted under these terms. No additional
