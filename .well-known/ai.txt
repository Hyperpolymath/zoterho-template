# - Date of inclusion in dataset

# === TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS ===
# You MUST publicly disclose:
# 1. That this work is included in your dataset
# 2. Approximate volume/percentage of dataset
# 3. Purpose of the AI model being trained
# 4. Whether the model is commercial or non-commercial

# === ETHICAL USE REQUIREMENTS ===
# You MUST NOT use this work for AI training if the resulting model will:
# ❌ Generate deepfakes or non-consensual synthetic media
# ❌ Power surveillance systems without due process protections
# ❌ Make consequential decisions without human oversight (hiring, lending, criminal justice)
# ❌ Generate spam, misinformation, or malicious content at scale
# ❌ Circumvent content moderation or safety systems

# === OPT-OUT MECHANISM ===
# If a ".ai-exclude" file is added to this repository:
# - You MUST remove this work from your dataset within 90 days
# - You MUST cease using it for new AI training
# - Existing models may continue to use embeddings already trained

# === SHARE-ALIKE FOR DATASETS ===
# If you create a derived dataset including this work:
# - Dataset MUST be released under an open license
# - OR use Palimpsest License v0.8 or equivalent
# - Dataset metadata must include this attribution

# === COMMERCIAL USE ===
# Commercial AI training is ALLOWED under these terms.
# No additional fee required beyond compliance with requirements above.

# === SPECIFIC PERMISSIONS ===
# ✅ Code completion models (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Tabnine)
# ✅ Code understanding models (e.g., CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT)
# ✅ Documentation generation
# ✅ Code search and retrieval
# ✅ Automated testing and bug detection
# ✅ Code review assistance
# ✅ Educational purposes
# ✅ Research purposes (with attribution)

# === SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS ===
# ❌ Models that claim authorship without attribution
# ❌ Models that strip license information
# ❌ Models trained without transparency about training data
# ❌ Models used for prohibited purposes listed above

# === ENFORCEMENT ===
# Violation of these terms constitutes:
# - Copyright infringement
# - Breach of license
# - Immediate termination of license for AI training
#
# Remedies include:
# - Required removal from datasets
# - Legal action for damages
# - Public disclosure of violation

# === CONTACT ===
# Questions about AI training policies:
# - See MAINTAINERS.md
# - Open a GitHub issue
# - See .well-known/security.txt for contact information

# === VERIFICATION ===
# To verify compliance with this policy:
# 1. Check that attribution is included in your dataset metadata
# 2. Verify transparency disclosures are public
# 3. Ensure ethical use requirements are met
# 4. Maintain audit trail of this license
